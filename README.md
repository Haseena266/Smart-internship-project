# Transfer Learning-Based Classification of Poultry Diseases

This project is developed as part of the **SmartInternz Virtual Internship Program**, focusing on applying **Artificial Intelligence and Transfer Learning** techniques to detect and classify poultry diseases from images.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Poultry farmers face challenges in early and accurate detection of bird diseases, which can lead to widespread infection and economic losses. Manual identification is time-consuming and error-prone.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

This project uses **transfer learning** with pre-trained deep learning models (like MobileNetV2) to classify poultry diseases from images efficiently. By fine-tuning on a poultry disease dataset, the model achieves fast and accurate predictions, helping farmers and organizations in effective poultry health management.
